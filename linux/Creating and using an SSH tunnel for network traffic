ssh-keygen                                                      (to generate ssh keys that will be used for logging in)
ssh-copy-id USER_NAME@IP_ADDRESS                                (copy public key to remote server)
ssh -f USER_NAME@IP_ADDRESS -L 2000:IP_ADDRESS:PORT_NUMBER -N   (Creates ssh tunnel and sends it to background (-f) and specifies that connections on localhost:2000 should be forwarded to the remote host port. -N option is for not executing a remote command)
curl localhost:2000                                             (command will be forwarded to remote host port per above)
