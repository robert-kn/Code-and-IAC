Apache Airflow is a Python framework that helps create workflows using multiple technologies using both CLI and a user-friendly WebUI. An Apache Airflow Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a Python program where you define the tasks and the pipeline with the order in which the tasks will be executed.

Airflow offers a wide range of operators, including many that are built into the core or are provided by pre-installed providers. Some popular core operators include:

BashOperator - executes a bash command

PythonOperator - calls an arbitrary Python function

EmailOperator - sends an email

The other core operators available include:
