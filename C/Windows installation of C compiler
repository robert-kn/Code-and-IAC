I installed microsft visual studio (2022) build tools on my laptop in order to install the microsoft visual 
C/C++ (MSVC) compiler on my device. 

To verify compiler installation on windows after installing MVS build tools, open the developer command prompt
for VS by typing 'developer' in the start menu. Check your MVSC installation by typing cl on the command prompt.
You should see a copyright message with the version and basic usage description. 

Note; to use the MSVC from the command line or VS code, you must run from a developer command prompt for VS. An ordinary shell such as powershell, Bash or the windows command prompt does not have the necessary path environment 
variables set.
